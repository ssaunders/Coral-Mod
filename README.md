Coral Mod for MineCraft

This mod has been created as part of a senior project. It uses MineCraft as platform to study complexity in cellular automata. A Cellular automaton is an initial state (usually represented as squares on a grid) which changes to different states as simple rules are repeatedly applied. The current state of the automaton dictates the next state. Though simple in nature, the internal interactions can be complex. Conway's Game of Life, one popular automaton, is Turing complete. Most often implemented in software, these “machines” help us understand more about evolution, living systems, and the development of life. This repo contains a group of entities modeled after coral. Each "species" of entity possesses the same set of characteristics, but vary in survival strategies. A variety of tests place individual entities into simulated ecosystems, both on its own and in competition with other species, and measure the growth of each species. As an additional measurement, the environment's Kolmogorov complexity is calculated.
